  <p>
    Hello! My name is <strong>Zhenyu Lei</strong> (pronounced like "Jen-yoo Lei"). 
    I am currently pursuing a M.S. degree in Southeast University, fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://fei-tong.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Fei Tong</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My primary research interest lies in <strong>Hardware Fuzzing</strong> for <strong>Microarchitectural Security</strong>, aiming to 1) automate the process of finding leakage primitives, 2) exploit them via side-channels, and 3) develop defenses against these attacks. Furthermore, I am currently exploring <strong>AI-driven approaches</strong> (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation), to assist in the discovery of unknown microarchitectural vulnerabilities.
