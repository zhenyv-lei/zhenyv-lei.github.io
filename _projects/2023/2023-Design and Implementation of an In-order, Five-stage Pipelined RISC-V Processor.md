abstract: >-
  1) Designed and implemented a tape-out ready RISC-V SoC, key modules including Instruction Decode Unit (IDU), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), data/instruction memory, General Purpose Registers (GPRs), and Control and Status Registers (CSRs).<br/>
  2) Optimized module interfaces and pipeline control logic to ensure full 5-stage in-order pipeline functionality (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB), supporting precise exception handling and instruction flow consistency.<br/>
  3) Built a verification platform integrating an interactive debugger and DiffTest with NEMU to ensure cycle-level correctness, validating system robustness by successfully booting complex workloads like Super Mario Bros at 24 FPS.<br/>
