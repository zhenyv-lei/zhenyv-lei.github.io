abstract: >-
  1) Reproduced Spectre v1 attacks on RISC-V processors and systematically analyze microarchitectural side-channel vulnerabilities.<br/>
  2) Introduced Flush Key Load (FKL), a novel detection metric for identifying abnormal cache access patterns indicating Spectre-like behavior; validated its effectiveness on gem5 and Chipyard.<br/>
  3) Designed a dual-layer defense strategy which uses FKL to trigger coordinated hardware-software mitigation; benchmark results demonstrated the strategy’s robust resistance to Spectre v1 attacks with only ~2% performance overhead.<br/>
