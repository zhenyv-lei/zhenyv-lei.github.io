abstract: >-
  1) Proposed a lightweight, privacy-preserving framework to mitigate critical biometric vulnerabilities, including voiceprint leakage, spoofing, and identity theft in mobile environments.<br/>
  2) Developed a Vector Quantization (VQ) recognition pipeline by extracting Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) acoustic features and generating user-specific voiceprint templates via the LBG algorithm.<br/>
  3) Optimized deployment for resource-constrained mobile platforms, achieving high recognition precision with low computational and memory overhead in real-world experiments.<br/>
