abstract: >-
  1) Led a team to design and implement Aware+Fuzz, a novel two-module architecture for mitigating cache side-channel attacks on RISC-V processors. Aware+Fuzz consists of an Aware Attack Module (AAM) and a Fuzz Observation Module (FOM).<br/>
  2) Validated on RISC-V hardware and gem5, demonstrating robust defense against Spectre attacks with negligible overhead (<1% on SPEC CPU 2017) and seamless hardware compatibility.<br/>
