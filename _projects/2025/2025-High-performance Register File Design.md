abstract: >-
  1) Designed a parallel register file (15W5R, 256×32 bit) with dual-cycle read and single-cycle write timing, implementing address pre-decoding and parallelized priority encoding strategies to reduce arbitration complexity for shortening the critical path.<br/>
  2) Established an automated verification pipeline to ensure RTL and gate-level consistency through cycle-accurate comparisons against reference models.<br/>
  3) Applied timing-driven optimizations (e.g., retiming and min-delay constraints) using Cadence Genus and Innovus to achieve timing closure at 300 MHz operating frequency.<br/>
  4) Conducted dynamic and static power analysis using Cadence Joules with SDF back-annotation and switching activity waveforms.<br/>
