abstract: >-
  1) Designed and implemented a novel mechanism to address clock drift and desynchronization in heterogeneous IoT networks caused by processor frequency discrepancies.<br/>
  2) Optimized the IEEE 802.11 MAC RTS/CTS handshake to carry processor frequency metadata across nodes, followed by developing a calibration algorithm integrating frequency preprocessing and error-threshold-based correction to achieve precise, power-efficient synchronization across heterogeneous devices.<br/>
  3) Experiments on the Contiki OS with MicaZ and Z1 sensor platforms showed that synchronization errors were transformed from unbounded growth into bounded stability.<br/>
